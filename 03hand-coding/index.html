        <h1>Where to Start?</h1>
        <p>It’s a question that crops up a lot in my DM’s – <em>where the hell do you find style inspiration?!</em> So I thought today I’d dissect the answer for you because quite honestly inspiration is right in front of us every single day and it’s easy to soak it up, but not so easy to work out exactly how to apply it to <a href="finetuning.html#fine">your own style,</a> especially without feeling the need to buy a whole new outfit. So here’s my advice…</p>
        <p><strong>In real life.</strong> Styling inspiration is often sitting on your front door. I know it’s a bit ‘I saw Regina George wearing army pants and flip-flops’, but more often than not the people you surround yourself with are your biggest influences. But don’t just limit it to family, friends and peers, keep your eyes peeled when you’re out an about and window-shop next time you’re in town. Plus whenever I’m scrolling online retailers I always find cool ways to wear things. I screengrab them whenever I find them and save them in a folder on my desktop.</p>
        <p><strong>Instagram.</strong> For me this the platform where I find the most styling inspiration. IG have made it really easy to do thanks to the save feature (although the same can’t be said for stories currently, so I tend to screen grab those and save them in a folder on my phone), and whenever I wake up and have no idea what to wear, it’s the first place I head.</p>
        <p><strong>Pinterest.</strong> It’s an incredible platform to find outfit inspiration. I tend to find what I want there quickest when I search an exact clothing item. So for example, maybe I want to find more ways to way my beige trench, I search for exactly that and am served thousands of images with a huge variety of styling ideas. Whereas Instagram might be better for general styling muses and creating more of a moodboard, Pinterest is where I head when I want to find more ways to wear what I already have.</p>
