                        <dd>The color you wear can really bring out the naturals colors that we see in your skin, hair, and eyes. Some colors are more slimming, and can even affect the mood that your outfit is giving off.</dd>

                        <dd>Patterns also can have a slimming, or even widening effect on your body. You can use pattern in your style to visually change your shape or sometimes your height appearance.</dd>
